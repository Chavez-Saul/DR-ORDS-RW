# Disaster Recovery with ORDS

Disaster Recovery Network and connectivity setup
=======================================================

This solution provides a Network Architecture deployment to demonstrate Disaster Recovery scenario across 2 regions [ examples are geared towards region Ashburn & Phoenix and can be used for any OCI regions].


## Quickstart Deployment

1. Clone this repository to your local host. The `DR-ORDS-RW` directory contains the Terraform configurations for a sample topology based on the architecture described earlier.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Chavez-Saul/DR-ORDS-RW.git
    ```
2. Zip up all the files except fot for rackwaressaleplay and gitignore.
3. Make use to create a public bucket in object storage. Upload apex.zip and the ords.war file to the bucket.

4. Navigate to the resource manager tab in OCI. Then create a new stack to import the zip file.

5. If you want to delete the infrastructure, run:
    First navigate to OCI Console and terminate the Standby database and once the termination is successfull then run the following command
    ```
    $ terraform destroy
    ```
    When youâ€™re prompted to confirm the action, enter yes.

## Inputs required in the terraform.tfvars file
The following inputs are required for terraform modules:
